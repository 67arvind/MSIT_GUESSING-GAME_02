# MSIT_GUESSING-GAME_02
Build a C program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number and displays the attempt count. Happy guessing! ðŸ˜Š
